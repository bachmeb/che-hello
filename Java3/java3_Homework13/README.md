Create a new project named java3_Homework13 in your Java3_Homework working set. Copy your latest GUIDemo applet and all associated files into the new project (you can just copy the src directory and everything will be copied).

Using your java3_Homework13, finish the project.

Allow a user to make a choice between drawing at least four different graphical objects (one should be a Rectangle, another an Oval, and the last two you need to design and implement.)

Allow the user to edit these objects (Move, Remove, Resize, Change (lineColor, fillColor, and filled), Clear, Fill).

If two objects overlap, select the last object drawn.

When an object is selected for Move or Resize, temporarily change its visual representation in some way (lighter, darker, or other cool stuff). When it is released, set it back to its original condition. This will give the user a visual clue which object is selected. You can go farther than just changing the color; be creative. Just remember to set it back when you are done.

Much of this is already done. However, someone else might need to maintain it later. Your code should be clean, formatted (Source Menu: Format), and use good coding standards and conventions. For example, use meaningful variable names. Take some time and fix everything that has bugged you about the coding.

Add block comments ( /* ... */ ) before each method, explaining what the method does. Eclipse helps you with these: type /* and press Enter and it will complete the comment block for you and place the cursor in the typing position. Add other comments where you believe something needs to be explained further, or where you did something cool and you want to brag. No need to comment getters and setters--we all know what they do.

In short, an experienced Java programmer should be able to take your code and understand it just by reading it, with comments to help when the code gets overly complex.

These are the requirements, but you can add any features you like.

When you finish, submit java3_Homework13.
