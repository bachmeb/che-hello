Create a new project named java3_Homework08 in your Java3_Homework working set. Copy your GUIDemo applet and all associated files into this project. Make sure any updates in the last project are incorporated into this project.

Add the following nested classes to your java3_Homework08 project:

A static nested class ColorPanel which creates a panel (and listeners) for two Color choice boxes, one for the line color and one for the fill color. Provide at least 8 colors. Use the same techniques you learned in previous lessons. These Choice boxes should work; if a user chooses a line color of Blue, the model should be updated so that the next figure drawn will have a Blue line color, etc. The choice boxes should be properly labeled. A good place for this nested class is in the ControlsPanel or MainPanel. The idea is to put the class close to where it is used to make maintenance easier.
Modify the ButtonPanel's Clear button so that it no longer uses an anonymous inner class, but rather, a local inner class. Its functionality should not change.
