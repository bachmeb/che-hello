Create a new project named java3_Homework02 in your Java3_Homework working set. 
Copy your latest version of the SalesReport.java program to the java3_Homework02 project and enhance it with methods to do the following:

Find and print the minimum sale. Print both the ID of the salesperson with the min sale and the amount of the sale; for example, "Salesperson 3 had the lowest sale with $4500."
After the list, sum, average, max, and min have been printed, ask the user to enter a value.
Then print the ID of each salesperson who exceeded that amount, and the amount of their sales.
Also print the total number of salespeople whose sales exceeded the value entered.
When finished, submit java3_Homework02 with the Main and edited SalesReport classes.
