Make an Applet that instantiates three threads.
Each thread should be started via a button click on the applet.
When started, each thread should print out its name and the time it started.
It should then go to sleep for a specified amount of time.
When it wakes, it should print out its name, how long it was put to sleep, and how long it actually has been asleep.
It should then be put to sleep again.
Allow each thread to run through this cycle at least 4 times.
The output should be put into a TextArea (or JTextArea) so that it does not get written over each time and can be inspected after all is complete.
You should have a TextArea (or JTextArea) for each thread's information.
You can also (that is, in addition to, not instead of) provide the output in the console if you wish.
