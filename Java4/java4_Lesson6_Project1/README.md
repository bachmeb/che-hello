Extend your latest version of the SalesApp application (including its Init, Input, and Output Panels), making sure that any input from the user will not cause an exception that you do not handle. Possible additional problem inputs include:
characters/Strings (typing a character like e rather than a number)
nothing there (empty Strings)
use of commas, dollar signs, decimals , etc.
Note that this also means to make sure that the Number of SalesPeople and Sales Goal will also always be valid (we only did the salesperson values in the lesson).
