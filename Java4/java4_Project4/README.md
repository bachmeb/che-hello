In the Java4_Homework working set, make a new java4_Project4 project, and create a salesGUI package in it. Copy all of the classes from the java4_Lesson1/src/salesGUI package into the new java4_Project4/src/salesGUI package.

In the first lesson, we added a calculateMinMax() method to the SalesApp class. For this project, add a "MinMax" choice to the Options menu to access that method and display only its results in the output pane.

As the project currently exists, it does not display information for salespeople who do not reach the goal. Add the functionality to display the results for those salespeople.

Change the output so that all dollar amounts use the df1 decimal format we used for the average.

Submit the java4_Project4 project when ready.
